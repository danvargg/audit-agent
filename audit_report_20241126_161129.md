## Executive Summary

This audit aimed to evaluate the compliance of the Design and Development Process with relevant regulatory standards, specifically ISO 13485:2016. Through a systematic review of documentation and process adherence, several non-conformities were identified concerning the organization's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) related to design control. Immediate corrective actions are recommended to align with the ISO requirements and ensure the robustness of the design and development framework, ultimately safeguarding product quality and compliance.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. ISO Clause Reference: 7.3.1 - General
- **Non-Conformity Description:** The SOP does not explicitly mention that documented procedures for design and development should exist.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Lacks section describing requirements for documenting all stages of design and development.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate risk due to insufficient documentation leading to potential oversight in design management.  
- **Recommendation:** Revise SOP to include mandatory documentation procedures for design and development phases.  

### 2. ISO Clause Reference: 7.3.2 - Design and Development Planning
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Planning does not clearly define stages, review processes, and responsibilities.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Fails to outline a structured planning process with milestones and review points.  
- **Risk Assessment:** High risk for project delays and miscommunication during design phases.  
- **Recommendation:** Develop a detailed design plan that includes all project milestones and assigned responsibilities.

### 3. ISO Clause Reference: 7.3.4 - Design and Development Outputs
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Outputs do not provide appropriate information for purchasing, production, and service provision.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Design output section lacks clarity on supporting purchasing and production.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate risk as it may lead to improper product development reflecting market needs.  
- **Recommendation:** Clearly state how design outputs will be utilized in purchasing and production requirements.

### 4. ISO Clause Reference: 7.3.5 - Design and Development Review
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Does not define systematic reviews at planned stages.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Absence of documented processes for design reviews.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate risk due to undefined review stages, potentially causing design flaws.  
- **Recommendation:** Establish a formal review process at each design stage for thorough assessments.

### 5. ISO Clause Reference: 7.3.7 - Design and Development Validation
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Validation processes are insufficient, particularly regarding clinical evaluations.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Lacks references to validation strategies or clinical evaluation processes.  
- **Risk Assessment:** High risk for non-compliance with clinical safety and efficacy standards.  
- **Recommendation:** Include comprehensive validation processes for design development in the SOP.

### 6. ISO Clause Reference: 7.4.1 - Purchasing Process
- **Non-Conformity Description:** No clear criteria for supplier evaluation based on compliance.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Inadequate details on supplier assessment for performance and quality.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate risk as this may lead to the selection of non-compliant suppliers.  
- **Recommendation:** Define supplier evaluation criteria and processes in compliance with ISO standards.

### 7. ISO Clause Reference: 8.2.1 - Feedback
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Lacks a process for gathering customer feedback on product performance.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** No mention of feedback collection or utilization methods.  
- **Risk Assessment:** High risk for losing insights into customer needs and satisfaction levels.  
- **Recommendation:** Implement a formal feedback mechanism to collect and analyze customer experiences.

### 8. ISO Clause Reference: 8.3 - Control of Nonconforming Product
- **Non-Conformity Description:** Procedures for identifying and controlling nonconforming products are poorly documented.  
- **Evidence from SOP:** Does not specify handling or disposition processes for nonconforming products.  
- **Risk Assessment:** High risk of undetected nonconforming products reaching the market.  
- **Recommendation:** Enhance documentation for nonconformance management to mitigate risks.

## Conclusion

The findings from this audit indicate significant gaps in the current SOP regarding design control processes against the benchmarks of ISO 13485:2016. Addressing these non-conformities is crucial for regulatory compliance and for ensuring product safety and effectiveness. The recommended corrective actions aim to strengthen the quality management system and enhance operational efficiency.
