# Audit Report: ISO 13485:2016 Compliance Review of 'QP03 Rev 9.0 Design Control'

## Introduction
This audit report presents the findings from the review of the document titled 'QP03 Rev 9.0 Design Control', specifically focusing on compliance with Section 7.3 (Design and Development Control) of the ISO 13485:2016 standard. The objective of this review is to identify any non-conformities with the requirements set forth in the standard.

## Findings

### Finding 1
- **Document Section:** 7.3.1 General
- **Finding:** The organization has not documented procedures for design and development as required.
- **Standard Reference:** ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.1: "The organization shall document procedures for design and development."
- **Reason:** The absence of documented procedures for design and development indicates a failure to establish a systematic approach to managing design and development processes, which is essential for ensuring product quality and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Recommendation:** Develop and document comprehensive procedures for design and development that outline the processes, responsibilities, and methods to be used.

### Finding 2
- **Document Section:** 7.3.3 Design and Development Inputs
- **Finding:** The organization has not maintained records of inputs relating to product requirements as specified.
- **Standard Reference:** ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.3: "Inputs relating to product requirements shall be determined and records maintained."
- **Reason:** Failure to maintain records of design and development inputs can lead to ambiguity in requirements and hinder the ability to verify that the design meets the necessary specifications.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a system to ensure that all inputs related to product requirements are documented and maintained as records.

### Finding 3
- **Document Section:** 7.3.5 Design and Development Review
- **Finding:** There is no evidence of systematic reviews of design and development at suitable stages as required.
- **Standard Reference:** ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.5: "At suitable stages, systematic reviews of design and development shall be performed."
- **Reason:** The lack of systematic reviews can result in undetected issues during the design process, potentially leading to non-conforming products.
- **Recommendation:** Establish a formal review process at defined stages of design and development to evaluate the ability of the results to meet requirements.

### Finding 4
- **Document Section:** 7.3.9 Control of Design and Development Changes
- **Finding:** The organization has not documented procedures to control design and development changes.
- **Standard Reference:** ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.9: "The organization shall document procedures to control design and development changes."
- **Reason:** Without documented procedures for controlling changes, there is a risk of implementing changes that could adversely affect product quality or compliance.
- **Recommendation:** Create and implement documented procedures for managing design and development changes, including evaluation, verification, and validation processes.

### Finding 5
- **Document Section:** 7.3.10 Design and Development Files
- **Finding:** The organization has not maintained a design and development file for each medical device type or family.
- **Standard Reference:** ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.10: "The organization shall maintain a design and development file for each medical device type or medical device family."
- **Reason:** The absence of a design and development file limits the ability to demonstrate conformity to design requirements and regulatory compliance.
- **Recommendation:** Establish and maintain a design and development file for each medical device type or family, including all relevant documentation and records.

## Conclusion
The review of the 'QP03 Rev 9.0 Design Control' document has identified several non-conformities with the ISO 13485:2016 standard, specifically in the areas of design and development control. These findings indicate a need for significant improvements in documentation and procedural adherence to ensure compliance with the standard. It is recommended that the organization take immediate action to address these non-conformities and consider a follow-up audit to verify the implementation of corrective actions. Further human review may be necessary to assess the overall quality management system's effectiveness in meeting regulatory requirements.
