**Finding Summary for Document 'QP03 Rev 9.0 Design Control': Section 7.3 (Design and Development Control) Compliance Analysis**

---

### Non-Conformity #1

1. **Document Section**: Section 7.3.1 - General
2. **Finding**: The document does not clearly state the specific procedures for design and development as required by this section. While it mentions that procedures should be documented, it lacks details on the required elements of these procedures.
3. **Standard Reference**: ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.1 states that the organization shall document procedures for design and development.
4. **Reason**: Failure to document clear procedures can lead to inconsistencies in the design and development processes, potentially affecting compliance with customer and regulatory requirements.
5. **Recommendation**: The organization should develop and clearly document specific procedures for each stage of the design and development process detailing roles, responsibilities, and methods to ensure compliance with requirements.

### Non-Conformity #2

1. **Document Section**: Section 7.3.3 - Design and Development Inputs
2. **Finding**: The document does not adequately define how design inputs will be verified for completeness, ambiguity, and conflict with one another.
3. **Standard Reference**: ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.3 states that requirements shall be complete, unambiguous, able to be verified or validated, and not in conflict with each other.
4. **Reason**: Without a documented process to ensure that inputs are complete and unambiguous, there is a risk of errors in design, leading to non-conforming products.
5. **Recommendation**: The organization should incorporate steps for comprehensive review and approval of design inputs, ensuring they meet the requirements specified by the standard.

### Non-Conformity #3

1. **Document Section**: Section 7.3.7 - Design and Development Validation
2. **Finding**: The document lacks procedures that specify the need for validation to be conducted on representative products, particularly emphasizing the need to document the rationale for the choice of products used for validation.
3. **Standard Reference**: ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.7 specifies that design validation must be conducted on representative products.
4. **Reason**: Missing this step can compromise the assurance that the outputs meet the specified requirements for intended use and application, leading to potential safety and performance issues.
5. **Recommendation**: Implement a procedure that requires design validation to be performed on definitive products representative of intended use, including clearly documenting the rationale for the product selected for validation.

---

### Non-Conformity #4

1. **Document Section**: Section 7.3.9 - Control of Design and Development Changes
2. **Finding**: The document does not provide an adequate description of how changes to design and development are controlled, gauged by their significance regarding performance, usability, safety, and regulatory requirements.
3. **Standard Reference**: ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.9 mandates that organizations document procedures to control design and development changes and determine their significance.
4. **Reason**: Inadequate controls can result in untracked changes that may adversely affect the product, leading to compliance risks.
5. **Recommendation**: Establish comprehensive documentation and processes that dictate how design changes are managed, including evaluation criteria for the significance of changes and tracking systems.

### Non-Conformity #5

1. **Document Section**: Section 7.3.10 - Design and Development Files
2. **Finding**: The organization has not explicitly defined the content and organization of the design and development files, nor detailed what records should be included to demonstrate conformity to design requirements.
3. **Standard Reference**: ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3.10 specifies that design and development files must include necessary records for conformity.
4. **Reason**: Without clearly defined content, there is a risk that necessary documentation may be omitted, leading to difficulties in demonstrating compliance and managing product accountability.
5. **Recommendation**: Develop a template or checklist for design and development files that includes all required documentation to ensure comprehensive compliance with the standard.
